<h3><span>Changes to the Terms of Service and the Website</span></h3> 
<p>Plan Here is a work in progress, and as such things may change, be added or be taken away. We reserve the right to update the Website and these Terms of Service from time to time, at our discretion and without any notice. It is solely your responsibility to keep up-to-date with the latest Terms and Conditions by checking back regularly. Your continued use of the Website following the publishing of updated Terms of Service will be taken to mean that you have read and agree to the changes.</p> 
<h3><span>Access to the Website</span></h3> 
<p>We work hard to ensure the Website is always up and available, but we can't guarantee that the Website will not have downtime for any reason. We reserve the right to close the Website for short periods of time for general maintenance, but will attempt to keep this to a minimum. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of the Website is unavailable at any time, for any length of time.</p> 
<p>Parts of the Website require you to input a password to access certain features. This is to be able to give you details relevant to your order whilst still keeping them private to you. To do this, as part of our security procedures, we require you to register an account with Plan Hereby entering your email and choosing a secure password.

There is a password reset procedure in case you forget your password. You must treat your account log-in information as confidential, not disclosing it to any third party and only using Plan Here in person.

<h3><span>Product information</span></h3> 
<p>Plan Here takes great care when putting product/service information, descriptions and images on-line but will not be held responsible for any mistakes or omissions to any information given.</p> 
<h3><span>Prices</span></h3> 
<p>The prices indicated on Plan Here are shown in Indian Rupees (₹) and do not include extra charges. The extra charges are clearly shown and invoiced at the end of the order in addition to the price of the products. We reserve the right to modify our prices at any moment but this will be indicated to you on the order at the time the order is placed. If an obviously incorrect price appears on our website and is not corrected on your total at the time of order completion, for whatever reason (human error, technical error etc.), your order will be cancelled and the payment refunded to you, even if it has been initially validated.</p> 
<h3><span>Availability</span></h3> 
<p>We will always endeavour to fulfil your order once completed and paid for. If a product/service becomes unavailable after your order has been confirmed and paid for, we will refund the price you paid for the product/service within 30 days following the date of payment. If your order includes products/services that are temporarily unavailable, we will reserve/book the available products/services out first and will follow with the outstanding services once they are available again. We will refund the some of the extra charges for the rest of the order. If relevant, we will offer you a replacement for an unavailable product/service, a product/service of equal price and class. If you choose to decline this offer, and the original product/service is permanently unavailable, we will reimburse the price of the unavailable product/service.</p> 
<h3><span>Secure payment</span></h3> 
<p>Plan Here currently offers two ways to pay for your order, Paytm Wallet &amp; PayU. These payment options use advanced SSL encryption to keep your transaction secure and do not cost you anything to use (Plan Here is charged as the seller, you are not charged as the buyer) so you will not pay any extra for your order. You may or may not need to hold an account with these Merchants to use these methods of payments. Please refer to Paytm Wallet &amp; PayU for full terms and conditions of use.</p> 
<h3><span>Non-Provision of Service/Product</span></h3> 
<p>Plan Here does everything in its power to respect the services indicated on the website. We cannot, however, be held responsible for the consequences of changes in services or non provision of services by a third-party contracted to provide services/products, or by you, or because of some unforeseen event or an Act of God. In the event where you are not provided with the services referred, an investigation will be conducted with the third-party and may take several days upon receipt of your claim. During this period of investigation, no reimbursement will take place.</p> 
<h3><span>Right of Cancellation</span></h3> 
<p>Plan Here allows you to cancel a product/service that you are not satisfied or required with in only some exceptional cases if possible. Your right of cancellation starts from the moment your order is booked/reserved if the option of cancellation is provided. You can cancel the product/services within this time frame and the refund of whole amount including other charges may or may not be possible in all the cases or some of the charges paid by you may be withheld or will be deducted from the refund amount.</p> 
<p>Certain taxes and charges remain the customer’s responsibility. The present right of cancellation only applies to products/services that are cancelled before the allowed time frame. The deadlines mentioned above are effective from the date of receipt of the order.</p> 
<h3><span>For reimbursements:</span></h3> 
<p>If the product/service is cancelled within allowed time frame, the User will be reimbursed via the same payment method as was used initially. The payment method for reimbursement at some times may vary from the payment method through which the order amount was paid by you.</p> 
<h3><span>Privacy and protection of personal data</span></h3> 
<p>The details you give us are essential for the processing and delivery of your orders, for billing and for the establishment of warranty contracts, therefore failure to provide these details will result in the cancellation of your order.
